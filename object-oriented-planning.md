Object Oriented Planning
========================

The Steps
---------

1. Figure out what classes you need.
2. **Identify attributes** that change between individuals.
3. **Identify actions** that can be performed.
4. **Assign** every attribute and action to a class.
5. Identify which attributes should be their own class.
6. Identify which actions need additional information to do their job.

Attributes identified in step #2 will be **instance variables**.
Actions identified in step #3 will be **methods**.
Additional information identified in step #6 will be **arguments** you send to methods.
